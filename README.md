# Welcome!

## Introduction
This is development challenge for Java developer candidates at transferz. The goal of this task is to understand your way of thinking and problem-solving skills around composing new services, database design, SQL composing, understandign of multi-threading and unit-testing.

We are expecting that this task should take no more than 2 hours (including reading this documentation). Any result is important for us, if you feel that something is not solved it is not a problem. TODOs and comments in the source code are welcome.

Please fork this repository into your own GitHub account and send us the link to the repository when you have finished.

## The challenge
During high tide the dikes in The Netherlands have given way and we need to evacuate residents as soon as possible. One way to do this is by airlifting people out from Schiphol Airport. As this is an emergency, we're not concerned with where passengers will be taken, as long as we get them out as soon as possible. Each airplane used in the evacuation routine can have a maximum capacity of 150 passengers.

Please create a REST API service which handles data about airports, flights and passengers. At this time there is no need to think about scaling and running multiple instances of this service - assume that it will be running as a single instance. 

## You should:
* use Java 17, Spring Boot 2.6+, Maven 3.5+ (if you prefer Gradle that's also fine)
* select a relational database like H2, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
* create relevant tables for airports, flights and passengers (and another DB entities if needed) 
* create relevant DAOs, services and controllers
* add business logic to accomplish the tasks below
* ensure the application has at least 80% test coverage
* change the initial design to get better performance if needed
* ensure the Maven build is successful
* ensure the final JAR file is runnable
                       
## Database description

* Airport table should have at least:
  * `name` column as varchar(255)
  * `code` column as varchar(20)
  * `country` column as varchar(60)
* Flight table should have at least:
  * `code` column as varchar(20)
  * `originAirportCode` column as varchar(20)
  * `destinationAirportCode` column as varchar(20)
  * `departureDateTime` column as <your choice type>
  * `arrivalDateTime` column as <your choice type>
* Passenger table should have at least:
  * `name` column as varchar(1024)
  * `flightCode` column as varchar(20)

During the database design, please think about additional constraints and type of `id` field and way of its generation for better performance and security.

If you feel the database structure above is insufficient to cover the requirements you are free to change the structure as you see fit.

## REST API description 

We would like to see these endpoints:
* Retrieve all airports with pagination and optional filtering on name and code
* Add a new airport with validation for fields and unique code and name
* Add new passenger on a flight with validation for fields and unique name per flight
* Get statistical data based on the number of arriving and departing flights within certain time frames:
  * request has non-empty `start date time` as a parameter
  * request has non-empty `end date time` as a parameter
  * request has `time bucket` length (in minutes) as a parameter, with a default of 20 and no less than 5 minutes
  * result data should have structure similar to table with two columns:
    * 1st column is date and time of time-bucket
    * 2nd column is amount of flights in this time bucket 
  * if some time bucket has no flights then this item can be skipped or 0/null flights can be shown (as you wish)
  * preferably this result will be obtained directly from the database without additional business logic
  * example of response with time bucket size as 10 minutes:
    * ```
      2023-11-16 10:00 | 14    
      2023-11-16 10:10 | 8
      2023-11-16 10:20 | 24
      2023-11-16 10:30 | 1
      ```
  * example of JSON for this response (structure of JSON can differ)
    * ```
      [
         {
           "dt": "2023-11-16 10:00",
           "value": 14
         },
         ...
         {
           "dt": "2023-11-16 10:30",
           "value": 1
         }
      ]  
      ```
      In this example there were 14 flights arriving or departing from 2023-11-16 10:00 till 2023-11-16 10:10 (and so on). 
      
## Business logic

Additional functionality needed: 
* On each "Add new passenger" REST request, the service should calculate the amount of passengers per flight:
  * If the amount of passengers is 150 (amount externally configurable) or higher, the flight should depart and new passengers should be booked on the next flight
  * The destination of the flight should be auto-selected
  * A maximum of 3 planes can depart every minute

## Notes
* Please implement all part of the service with performance in mind
* Keep in mind that the service can receive parallel requests
* Remember that good tests cover negative scenarios as well
* You have any questions feel free to ask them, we are here to help you
* Do not forget to re-read the task to be sure every topic is covered
* Good luck!
